## Project Description

UniArts Network is a scalable DApps platform on Polkadot. UniArts network is a platform for art trading, auction and verification. UniArts is a set of UniArts Substrate Runtime Module Libraries that allows developers to add UniArts functions to their Substrate chain. We have published our white paper draft1. You can find further information from [here](https://github.com/uni-arts-chain/UniArts-white-paper/blob/master/uniarts-white-paper.pdf).

Since we are making modules, we can also make a parachain by importing these modules. We aim to be one of the firstest scalable and arts-nft parachains once Polkadot is successflly launched. At the same time, we firmly believe that cultural art is the best practice of NFT. UniArts chain is the basic platform of art NFT and the foundation of decentralized community management. Later, the Dapp will be built on the basis of UniArts chain. NFT can be issued in Dapp, providing NFT transaction, verification, incentive and other services.

With this grant, we keep developing UniArts chain and UniArts Dapp.

You can find more info about Chain and Dapp from [here](https://github.com/uni-arts-chain/UniArts-white-paper/blob/master/uniarts-white-paper.pdf).

### Why our Team choose Art NFT projects

The characteristics of art collection, verification and transaction are very suitable for the characteristics of blockchain and NFT.
Our team has rich art college resources and education industry background. Moreover, our team chose to help the original authors build a credit and traceability trading platform from colleges and universities, and realize the added value of artworks in the circulation through enhanced NFT technology. Purify the art exchange market and form a decentralized self-management community.
